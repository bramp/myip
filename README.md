*(A better)* What's My IP Address web application.
Determines both your IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, issues WHOIS and reverse DNS lookups, and shows all
your HTTP headers.

Check it in action: [ip.bramp.net](https://ip.bramp.net/) or [read about it on my blog](https://blog.bramp.net/post/2017/02/20/building-a-better-whats-my-ip-site/).

This project was quite literally hacked out in one weekend, and was my first App Engine project.

## Install

### Prerequisites

* [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs)
* AppEngine Go SDK

    ```shell
    $ gcloud components install app-engine-go
    ```

* [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (which comes on Linux or Mac)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Domains

As designed, this Go application will run on the Standard Google App Engine. It requires
two to three host names. One that is IPv4 only, and one that is IPv6 only. In my configuration
I have ip.bramp.net that has both A and AAAA records, ip4.bramp.net that has only A records,
and ip6.bramp.net that only has AAAA records. These all point to the same App Engine instance.

```
$ dig ip.bramp.net 
ip.bramp.net.		300	IN	A	216.239.32.21
ip.bramp.net.		300	IN	AAAA	2001:4860:4802:32::15

$ dig ip4.bramp.net
ip4.bramp.net.		300	IN	A	216.239.32.21

$ dig AAAA ip6.bramp.net
ip6.bramp.net.		300	IN	AAAA	2001:4860:4802:32::15
```

All three domain names should be configured in main.go (find the prodConfig var).

To deploy:

```shell
make deploy # to prod
make stage  # to stage
```

## Development

To run locally we use the addresses, [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080),
[127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080), and [http://[::1]:8080](http://[::1]:8080).
The first can be either, and the latter are IPv4 and IPv6 respectively.

To start up a local instance, just execute:

```shell
make serve
```

To test:

```shell
make test
```

### Libraries

To keep libraries up to date run:

```shell
make check-updates
make veryclean
make test
```


## TODO

- [ ] Add rate limiting of requests
- [ ] Add caching of DNS and WHOIS records (including the iana IP ranges)
- [ ] Add configuration file, so can be hosted on different domains
- [ ] Add a favicon.ico
- [ ] Add Make test (which checks with different build tags, e.g macos,appengine linux,appengine)
- [ ] Implement a App Engine Flex, and other PaaS environments
- [ ] Minify all css and js and combine into one file
- [ ] Do better at determining the root cause errors. e.g If both IPv4/IPv6 fail, then perhaps problem with the site. If IPv6 fails after 30 seconds, perhaps problem with IPv6 connectivity.
- [ ] Refactor the app. We don't need to seperate appengine and not appengine anymore. The code is almost identical.
